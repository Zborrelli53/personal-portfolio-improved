                <h3>Work</h3>
                <p>I work at the McDonald's in Canton, NY 3-4 days out of the week. I usually work, thursdays, fridays, saturdays, and mondays. It is a great entry level job for me<br> since I am in highschool. So the money is nice to have. I am using the money to help save for college, and some of it to spend on things I like. <br>The job is fast paced and you are never really standing around bored. I work in both grill and service.</p>
