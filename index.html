                    <p>Hey Folks! How has your day been? I am Zander Borrelli, but just call me Zander! I am an 11th grade student from a small town Called Canton located in upstate New York!<br> I am currently taking the Computer & Information Sciences course at the Seaway BOCES Tech Center. This class is perfect for me because I have been fascinsated<br> with technology ever since I got my first game console; The Nintendo 64. I remember being super intriuged with. it because of all of the colors, the sound,<br> and the excitement of the games. This led me to acquire other game consoles and devices in the future, and spark my interest in technology and computers.</p>

                    <p>In this class, we will learn about different coding languages such as: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. CSS has been my favorite coding language so far because i like seeing how a website looks after applying various designs to it. But, we haven't learned much about it at this point. </p>
